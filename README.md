Programming using an object oriented programming language. 

My mission is to develop skills in creating programs that use the object-oriented programming methodology, API classes, and user-defined classes. 

Throughout the process, proper program documentation using class diagrams and code comments are stressed. Unit testing is also introduced to help.

This repository includes projects that span across the CLI, as well as the GUI using Java Swing and FX.
