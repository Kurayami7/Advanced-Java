Programming using an object oriented programming language. 

My mission is to develop skills in creating programs that use the object-oriented programming methodology, API classes, and user-defined classes. 

Throughout the process, proper program documentation using class diagrams and code comments are stressed. Unit testing is also introduced to help.
